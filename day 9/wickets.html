    <P>In cricket, **wickets** play a central role in gameplay. A wicket consists of **three vertical stumps** and **two horizontal bails** placed on top. It is positioned at each end of the pitch. Bowlers aim to hit the wicket to dismiss the batter, which is called **being bowled**. A batter can also be out if the wicket is broken during a **run-out** or **stumping**. Wickets also refer to dismissals; for example, “5 wickets” means five players were out. Fielders and bowlers work together to take wickets and limit runs. Wickets are essential for determining the progress and result of a match.
