    <p>In cricket, **gloves** are essential protective gear worn by batters and wicketkeepers. **Batting gloves** protect the hands from high-speed balls and enhance grip on the bat handle. They are padded with foam or cotton on the fingers and palms to reduce the impact of fast deliveries. **Wicketkeeping gloves** are larger, with webbing between the thumb and fingers, helping catch the ball cleanly behind the stumps. Gloves prevent injuries like bruises, fractures, or cuts caused by ball impact. They also improve control and comfort during play. Both types are designed for flexibility, protection, and grip, making them vital equipment in cricket.</p><br>
