    <p>In cricket, **jerseys** are the official uniforms worn by players, serving both **functional and symbolic** purposes. Made from lightweight, breathable materials, jerseys help players stay **cool and comfortable** during long matches. In Test cricket, players wear traditional **white jerseys**, while in limited-overs formats like ODIs and T20s, they wear **colored jerseys** representing their team. Jerseys often display the **playerâ€™s name and number** on the back, along with **sponsor logos**. They promote team identity, unity, and national pride. Jerseys are also important for **fans and branding**, as they become a symbol of support and are often worn by cricket enthusiasts.</p><br>
