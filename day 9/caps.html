<p>In cricket, **caps** are worn by players for both practical and symbolic reasons. They help **protect the head and eyes from sunlight**, especially during long hours on the field. Caps also **absorb sweat**, keeping players comfortable and improving visibility. Teams often wear **colored caps** in limited-overs matches and **white caps** in Test cricket. Receiving a **national cap** is a moment of pride, symbolizing a player's debut for their country. Some players also wear **sun hats** or helmets depending on conditions. Overall, caps are important for **comfort, identity, and tradition**, making them a significant part of cricket attire.</p><br>
