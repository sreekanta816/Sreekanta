    <h1>MRF BATS</h1>
    <img src="./bat.webp">
    <p>**MRF cricket bats** are crafted from premium English or Kashmir willow. The process begins by selecting seasoned willow clefts, which are then shaped and pressed to enhance grain structure and strength. The bat is carefully carved to achieve balance, weight, and profile. The handle, made from cane and rubber strips, is fitted into the blade using a splice joint for shock absorption and flexibility. Skilled craftsmen hand-finish the bat, sanding and polishing it to perfection. MRF branding is added, and a protective cover may be applied. Each bat undergoes quality checks, ensuring it meets professional standards for performance and durability.
