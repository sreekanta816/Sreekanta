    <p>In cricket, a **helmet** is a vital piece of protective equipment worn by **batters**, **wicketkeepers**, and sometimes **close fielders** to guard against head injuries. Made from hard plastic with foam padding inside, helmets feature a **metal grille** to protect the face while allowing visibility. Batters wear helmets to defend against fast deliveries that could cause serious harm. Wicketkeepers wear them while standing close to the stumps, especially against spin bowlers. Helmets help prevent **concussions, fractures, and facial injuries**, making the game safer. Their usage has become mandatory in many formats, ensuring better protection for players at all levels of cricket.</p><br>
