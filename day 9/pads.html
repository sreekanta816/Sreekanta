    <p>In cricket, **pads** are protective gear worn by **batters and wicketkeepers** to shield their legs from injury. Made of lightweight yet strong materials like foam and leather, pads cover the knees, shins, and ankles. Batters wear **leg pads** on both legs to protect against fast deliveries, especially from hard leather balls. Wicketkeepers wear **special pads** that are lighter and allow more movement. Fielders close to the batter may also use pads for safety. Pads are secured with straps and are essential in preventing bruises, fractures, and other injuries, allowing players to perform confidently and safely during intense matches.</p><br>
