    <p>**Kookaburra balls** (commonly used in cricket) are made using high-quality leather and cork. First, layers of cork and tightly wound string are shaped into a solid core. This core is then covered with four pieces of alum-tanned leather, dyed typically red, stitched together with linen thread in a prominent seam. The seam is hand-stitched and serves both for grip and swing during play. The ball is then polished and coated with a layer of grease or wax to increase durability and shine. Kookaburra balls are machine-stitched and are known for their consistent bounce and hardness, ideal for professional matches.
